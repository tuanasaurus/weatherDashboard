# Weather Dashboard 

Create a Weather Dashboard that let a user serach for a city's current weather and 5-day forecast. 

## How I did the project 

1. Created the layout using bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
2. Created the HTML with the divs for the content from the script.js 
3. Signed up for the OpenWeather APi key (https://openweathermap.org/guide)
4. Looked at the OpenWeather's documentation to see how to grab the current weather
5. Looked into grabbing the icons from OpenWeather Conditons (https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)
6. Created the ajax call for the weather information 
7. Created a listening event for the search button
8. Making the city name into a button that appears below the search. 
9. Appending the current weather condiiton to a div in the HTML
10. Appending the 5 day forecasts as cards into the div below the current condition.
